Examples of narrative fiction, character development, and scene construction.

## Character and Setting: Bug and the Jellies

> Carefully extracting fish from the tentacles of this particular jelly was no easy task, and although Bug had done this for several years now—enough for the motions to become completely baked into his very muscles—the smell that burned his nose and eyes kept forcing him to pause to take a breath from under his smock. Here, at least, the smell of his own sweat masked out the stench of the duskweed flowers cooking in the sun. It was hot days like these when the plants were the worst. Bug paused, fish still partially encapsulated in the hair-like tentacles, looking out at the shore. There the massive plants shimmered under the yellowy fog of spores produced by the plants. He still couldn't believe that plants so beautiful had such a potent ability to kill. Well, at least not these fish. Bug turned back to the spiny thing that the jelly had caught. It was one of the bottom feeders, the ones that ate the sunken stalks and leaves of the plants. Somehow, it could survive the toxins in the plant, and was able to live in these treacherous waters. He lifted another layer of tentacles off with his gloved hand, wishing the day would end and he could take his boat back to his shack. At least there he was out of the hot sun, and was not at risk of getting jelly burns all the way up his arms.
>
> "Hey, if you're not gonna pull yours, will you help me with mine? This jelly's not cooperating, and keeps pulling this bluefin away from me."
>
> Bug turned to Syth. "I can see my money getting closer and closer! Perhaps you should have tried pulling fish yourself before making a bet."
>
> "Think of it as my way of repaying you that money you spent to get me my new boat."
>
> "I keep telling you, I traded for it with some guy who didn't want it anymore, only wanted to know about the jellies. I didn't pay him a copper."
>
> "Yeah, and I keep telling you, nobody trades away a boat as nice as that," he said, gesturing at his boat, "for some random facts about the jellies. What'd he even ask you anyways?"

**Key patterns:**
- Strong sensory details ("yellowy fog of spores," "smell that burned his nose")
- Character voice emerges through dialogue
- Em dashes for natural thought progression
- World-building details woven into action
- Natural dialogue that reveals character relationships

## High-Stakes Emotional Scene: Angela and Tai

> "No—fuck you!"
>
> "It's my ring, Angela! My ring. It cost me twelve hundred dollars, and you don't get a say in what I do with it." Tai made another snatch at her clenched fist, held high in the air.
>
> "You promised though, you—you asshole!" Angela could hear her voice crack.
>
> "What promise? We were just friends, Angela! That's it. Just. friends."
>
> "But…" Angela could see the city night reflecting off his dark eyes, glowing in stark contrast to the North Pacific behind him. They glowed with that dogged, thoughtful, irrational fire that made him Tai. It was those same glowing eyes she had seen when the two of them had climbed the Dory Moors ferris wheel out on the pier late one summer night and had talked about that feeling that sometimes lurked in the back alleys of their minds—as though something was missing—and it ached. She had doubted him, but he was certain he would find it, and said he would let her know what it was when he figured it out.
>
> "But what? I left for three years, Angela. We agreed things were over. We said—no—you said, 'I think it's best things stop.' You said, 'three years is a long time, and I don't know if I even like you like that, yet.' Well I knew. I fucking knew. I knew since the day I met you, when you stood there with your shoes off and your stupid, beautiful, stupid grin! I knew where I stood, I knew how I felt, and I knew that I could wait three years, or five years, or ten years, or however long it took. But you didn't know, and I left, and now I'm back. Now I'm back, and I've moved on. I'm getting married, Angela. I love her. And I know, and she knows, and she loves me. And—…"
>
> Angela's arm fell limp at her side. The ring had left her fingers before she knew what had happened. There hadn't even been much of a splash as the ring hit the water and sank beneath the waves.
>
> Tai was still—his body fixed. There was no glow in his eyes this time. "That was my ring."
>
> "I know," Angela said, turning away. "Now, I know."

**Key patterns:**
- Dialogue-driven with minimal tags
- Strategic fragments for emotional impact ("That's it. Just. friends.")
- Physical descriptions reveal emotion ("her voice crack," "his body fixed")
- Sensory details anchor emotion ("city night reflecting off his dark eyes")
- Action beats between dialogue
- Parallel structure in climactic moment ("I know," "Now, I know.")

## Moral Complexity: Morris Breaking In

> Morris surveyed the mantle as he gulped down another mouthful of cold, roast chicken. There was a pretty glass sculpture of deer—Thomas would have snatched that if he was here—and a few picture frames—it looked as if they maybe had a daughter? No wait, not they, maybe just mom? It was hard to see without any of the lights on. Yeah, definitely only mom. Where was dad? Morris felt a ping of guilt—no—no guilt; not for a family that had granite counter tops and a gas fireplace. He scanned the room for more signs of luxury. Stained wood table? Leather couch? Hard wood floors? He didn't know how much any of it cost, but it looked nice. That made him feel better.
>
> He reached for another piece of chicken. His mom made chicken like this sometimes, though whoever this woman was did it better—probably because it actually had spices. Morris couldn't hold back a grimace—he wished he didn't have thoughts like that. Mom had always tried to give Morris the upbringing that his friends had had. She'd make excuses to her boss and leave work early to spend an hour scouring the racks of Goodwill, looking for something that looked anything like what Morris' friends were wearing. She never bought anything you could microwave for dinner—"it's too processed, not good for a growing strong boy like you"—and would instead spend the precious free time she did have before her next shift to make Morris a "proper" dinner. "Proper" dinner was usually a single dish, and sometimes it was roast chicken. Morris sighed. At least his belly was full now. Now—just to grab maybe one more dish for the road, and he'd be out of this family's home.
>
> "Who are you?"
>
> Morris nearly dropped the empty tupperware, spinning around to see where the sound had come from. Standing atop the stairs behind him, a girl, no more than five, stared back at him.
>
> "Who are you?" Morris shot back. He didn't know why he said that—he knew who this girl was—she was from the picture on the mantle.
>
> "I'm Molly." She paused for a moment. "What are you doing?"
>
> "I'm…" Morris trailed off.
>
> Morris was not prepared for this. He thought the house was empty when he had shimmied the window open—there was no car in the driveway, and there wasn't any garage. What was she doing at home, alone? It was late, her mom should be home now. The girl was still waiting for an answer.
>
> "Where's your mother?" The words had come out of his mouth before he could stop them. He needed to get out of here.

**Key patterns:**
- Internal thought process shown through questioning ("Where was dad?")
- Self-correction reveals character ("no—no guilt")
- Em dashes for natural thought flow
- Questions used to build tension
- Character voice through observation and rationalization
- Specific details ground the scene in reality
