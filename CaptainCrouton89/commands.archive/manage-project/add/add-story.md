# Add User Story

Add user story linked to existing feature.

Template: `pdocs template user-story`

## Process

## ⚡ Delegation

**Default approach:** Delegate story drafting to `@agent-documentor` so you can keep orchestrating. Provide:
- Output path: `user-stories/US-###-<slug>.yaml`
- Template reference: "Run `pdocs template user-story` to view the structure"
- Story details: selected feature ID, gathered story inputs, acceptance criteria notes, and any pending questions
- Context: existing stories via `./list-stories.sh` to maintain sequential IDs

Continue collecting user input or prepping next commands while the agent works. Monitor via hook updates; only `await` if you must review the draft before moving forward.

**Inline exception:** Apply quick manual edits only when the user asks for a single-field correction. Otherwise default to the async delegation path.

### 1. Show Available Features
```bash
./list-features.sh
```

### 2. Determine Next Story ID
```bash
./list-stories.sh --format ids
```

### 3. Gather Story Details
Ask for:
- Feature ID (must exist)
- User story: "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria (2-5 Given/When/Then)

### 4. Present Draft & Confirm
Show story file preview.

### 5. Create Story File
Create `user-stories/US-###-<slug>.yaml` with template.

### 6. Validation
```bash
./check-project.sh --no-links
```

### 7. Next Steps

Present options to user:

```markdown
✓ Story US-### added and linked to feature F-##
✓ Acceptance criteria documented

**Next Steps:**

**Option 1: Add More Documentation**
- Add another story: `/manage-project/add/add-story`
- Check feature coverage: `/manage-project/validate/check-coverage`

**Option 2: Implement This Story**
- Start implementation: `/manage-project/implement/00-orchestrate US-###`
  - Runs investigation → planning → execution → validation
  - Focused implementation scoped to this specific story

**Option 3: Implement Entire Feature**
- Implement all stories for F-##: `/manage-project/implement/00-orchestrate F-##`
  - Comprehensive implementation of the full feature

Which path would you like to take?
```

## Edge Cases

### No user-stories/ directory
Create: `mkdir -p <project_root>/docs/user-stories`

### ID conflicts
Increment if US-113 exists: US-114, etc.

### Invalid feature ID
Verify exists with `./list-features.sh | grep "F-06"`

### Incomplete criteria
Require at least 2 acceptance criteria.

## Output
New user story file linked to feature.
