# Implementation Phase 4: Final Validation

Comprehensive validation of complete implementation against all requirements and acceptance criteria.

$ARGUMENTS

@docs/product-requirements.md
@docs/system-design.md
@docs/api-contracts.yaml
@agent-senior-engineer

## Purpose

Systematically verify that the complete implementation meets all requirements, follows patterns, handles edge cases, and introduces no regressions.

## Process

### 1. Load All Artifacts
- `@docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-requirements.md` - Requirements
- `@docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `agent-responses/agent_*.md` - Investigation findings and task validations
- Original specification (feature/story/API/flow)
- Implemented code

Verify execution phase complete. If missing artifacts, prompt to run `/manage-project/implement/execute` first.

### 2. Validation Strategy
**Simple (inline):** Small scope (1-3 tasks), single domain, straightforward requirements  
**Complex (delegated):** Large scope (4+ tasks), multi-domain, complex integration - delegate to `@agent-senior-engineer`

### 3. Delegate Final Validation Agent (if complex)
```markdown
Perform comprehensive final validation of {item-id} implementation.

**Context:**
- Requirements: @docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-requirements.md
- Implementation plan: @docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-plan.md
- Task validation reports: agent-responses/agent_*.md
- Investigation findings: agent-responses/agent_*.md
- Original specification: [Feature/Story/API spec path]
- Modified files: [list or git diff reference]

Analyze these artifacts to understand what was supposed to be built, then systematically verify the implementation meets all requirements, follows established patterns, handles edge cases appropriately, and introduces no regressions.

Determine your own validation strategy based on the complexity and domain of the implementation.
```

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
Validate across dimensions:

#### Requirements Compliance
- All functional requirements implemented
- All acceptance criteria met
- All user stories satisfied (if story-based)
- All API contract requirements met (if API)
- All success criteria achieved

#### Specification Alignment
- APIs match `@docs/api-contracts.yaml`
- Events match `@docs/data-plan.md` (if exists)
- UI matches `@docs/design-spec.md`
- Architecture follows `@docs/system-design.md`
- Behavior matches original specification

#### Task Completion
- All tasks from plan implemented
- All task validation reports reviewed
- All task validation issues resolved
- No pending or incomplete tasks

#### Code Quality
- Code follows project patterns and conventions from investigations
- Error handling consistent
- Proper validation
- Clear naming
- Appropriate comments

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Empty states handled gracefully
- Large datasets handled efficiently
- Invalid input validated and rejected
- Network failures handled (if applicable)
- Concurrent actions handled (if applicable)
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during async operations

#### Integration Points
- Integrates correctly with existing features
- API calls work as expected
- Database operations correct
- Authentication/authorization works
- External APIs integrated properly

#### Performance
- Time complexity acceptable
- No N+1 query problems
- No unnecessary re-renders (frontend)
- Efficient data structures
- Appropriate caching

#### Security
- Input validation prevents injection
- Authentication required where needed
- Authorization checks in place
- Sensitive data not logged
- CORS configured correctly (if API)

#### Accessibility (if UI)
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast meets WCAG
- Screen reader compatible

#### Regression Check
- Existing tests still passing
- Related features still working
- No breaking changes to APIs (unless intentional)
- Backward compatibility maintained (if required)

### 5. Consolidate Validation Results
```markdown
## Final Validation Summary

**Feature:** [F-## name]
**Overall Status:** ✓ PASS / ⚠ PASS WITH ISSUES / ✗ FAIL

### Requirements: [X/Y met]
- ✓ Requirement 1
- ✓ Requirement 2

### Code Quality: ✓ PASS
### Edge Cases: ✓ PASS
### Integration: ✓ PASS
### Performance: ✓ PASS
### Security: ✓ PASS
### Regressions: ✓ NONE

### Issues Found
**Critical Issues:** [Must fix before acceptance]
- [None / List issues]

**Non-Critical Issues:** [Should fix but not blocking]
- [None / List issues]
```

### 6. Handle Validation Issues
**Critical (must fix):** Requirements not met, breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks  
**Important (should fix):** Edge cases not handled, poor error messages, performance concerns  
**Minor (nice to fix):** Code polish, documentation improvements

Fix critical issues, re-validate, then present non-critical issues to user for decision.

### 7. User Acceptance
```markdown
## Final Validation Complete

**Feature:** [F-## name]
**Status:** ✓ Validation Passed

### Summary
- ✓ All requirements met
- ✓ All acceptance criteria satisfied
- ✓ All tasks completed and validated
- ✓ Code quality standards met
- ✓ No regressions introduced
- ✓ Edge cases handled
- ✓ Integration points working

**Validation Report:** agent-responses/agent_{agent_id}.md

Ready for acceptance?
```

Wait for user sign-off.

### 8. Update Project Documentation
After user acceptance:

```bash
# Verify cross-document consistency
/manage-project/validate/check-consistency

# Ensure feature/story/API coverage
/manage-project/validate/check-coverage

# Verify API alignment (if API feature)
/manage-project/validate/check-api-alignment
```

Update feature status from `in_progress` to `implemented`, update timestamps.

### 9. Implementation Complete
```markdown
## ✓ Implementation Complete

**Feature:** [F-## name]
**Implementation:** Complete and validated
**Validation Status:** Passed

### Artifacts Created
- Feature/Story/API implementation
- @docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-requirements.md
- @docs/plans/implement-{item-id}-plan.md
- agent-responses/agent_*.md (investigations and validations)

### Summary
[Brief description of what was implemented]

**Implementation lifecycle complete!**
```

## Output Artifacts

**Created:**
- `agent-responses/agent_{agent_id}.md` - Comprehensive validation report

**References:**
- All artifacts from investigation, planning, and execution phases

**Completes:** Implementation workflow

## Edge Cases

### Validation Fails Completely
- Determine if planning was flawed or execution went wrong
- May need to return to planning or execution phase
- Present options to user

### Minor Issues User Wants to Fix
- Return to execution phase for specific fixes
- Re-validate after fixes

### Validation Reveals Missing Requirements
- Document the gap
- Determine if critical or nice-to-have
- User decides: implement now or defer

### Regression Detected
- Document regression clearly
- Fix regression
- Re-validate thoroughly
