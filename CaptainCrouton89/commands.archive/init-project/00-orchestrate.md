description: Orchestrate full project documentation workflow from assessment through completion

# Initialize Project Docs — Orchestrated Workflow

Your job is to create or complete a minimal-but-complete project documentation set, automatically handling both greenfield (new) and brownfield (existing) scenarios.

**The workflow is fully automatic:** Assessment determines the path, then commands daisy-chain. Users don't need to know which scenario applies.

---

## ⚡ Delegation Decision

**This workflow generates 8+ structured documents** — a substantial multi-phase task.

**Recommended approach:**
- **DELEGATE** to a `documentor` agent for the complete workflow (assessment through completion)
- **HANDLE DIRECTLY** only if user explicitly requests inline execution OR for quick single-document updates

**When delegating, provide:**
- Project root path and collected inputs (personas, features, timeline)
- Reference to this orchestration file and to use `pdocs template [type]` for all documentation templates
- Instruction to follow gates, idempotency rules, and traceability conventions
- Clear expectation to write directly and make edits if adjustments are needed (except for automatic routing)

**Quick reference:** See `@CLAUDE.md` for full delegation heuristics.

## Entry Point: Automatic Assessment

**Immediately run:** `/commands/init-project/00a-assess-existing.md`

This command:
1. Detects greenfield vs brownfield scenarios
2. Validates existing documentation if present
3. Automatically routes to the appropriate workflow path
4. Executes the next command without user intervention

**Do not collect inputs manually.** The assessment and subsequent commands will gather what's needed.

---

## Setup: Copy Scripts and Guide (for greenfield projects)

**For new projects detected by assessment**, run the setup script from the project root:

```bash
cd <project_root>
bash ~/.claude/file-templates/init-project/setup-project-docs.sh
```

This script automatically:
- Creates `docs/` directory structure (user-flows/, user-stories/, feature-specs/)
- Copies management scripts (check-project.sh, generate-docs.sh, list-apis.sh, list-*.sh)
- Adds CLAUDE.md guide
- Makes all scripts executable

## Workflow Paths (handled automatically)

**Path A: Greenfield** (no existing docs)
- Assessment → 01-prd → 02-user-flows → 03-user-stories → 04-feature-specs → 05-system-design → 06-api-contracts → 07-data-plan → 08-design-spec → 09-traceability-pass

**Path B: Brownfield-Compliant** (existing docs following conventions)
- Assessment → 00b-selective-update → targeted updates via manage-project workflows → 09-traceability-pass

**Path C: Brownfield-Legacy** (existing docs, non-standard format)
- Assessment → 00c-normalize-legacy → 00b-selective-update → 09-traceability-pass

---

## Manual Override (rare)

If user explicitly specifies a starting point:
- "Start from PRD" → `/commands/init-project/01-prd.md`
- "Update API contracts" → `/commands/init-project/06-api-contracts.md`
- "Just validate" → `/commands/init-project/09-traceability-pass.md`

Otherwise, **always start with assessment**.

---

## Sequence (and gates)
1. PRD → `pdocs template product-requirements`
2. User Flows → `pdocs template user-flow`
3. User Stories → `pdocs template user-story`
4. Feature Specs → `pdocs template feature-spec`
5. System Design → `pdocs template system-design`
6. API Contracts → `pdocs template api-contracts`
7. Data Plan → `pdocs template data-plan`
8. Design Spec → `pdocs template design-spec`
9. Traceability/Consistency pass (no template needed; update all above as needed)

At each gate, write the document directly. If the user requests adjustments, edit the document accordingly.

---

## Idempotency rules
- Before generating, check if the target file(s) already exist under `<project_root>/docs`. If they do, read them and incorporate existing content, then write the improved version.
- For multi-file steps (flows, stories, feature specs): check per-item existence by naming conventions; update or append as appropriate.
- Write directly; if adjustments are needed, edit accordingly.

---

## Saving rules
- Mirror templates' structure in `<project_root>/docs`.
- Use these default names:
  - `docs/product-requirements.yaml`
  - `docs/system-design.yaml`
  - `docs/design-spec.yaml`
  - `docs/api-contracts.yaml`
  - `docs/data-plan.yaml`
  - `docs/user-flows/<slug>.yaml`
  - `docs/user-stories/US-<###>-<slug>.yaml`
  - `docs/feature-spec/F-<##>-<slug>.yaml`
- Maintain front-matter fields (`status`, `last_updated`, IDs) per templates.

---

## Cross-document conventions
- Feature IDs: `F-01..F-n` (unique). Story IDs: `US-101..` (unique). Link stories to `feature_id`.
- Keep `status: draft` until a gate is approved; then update to `approved`. Set `last_updated` to YYYY-MM-DD on save.
- Ensure PRD Feature List ↔ Feature Specs ↔ Stories ↔ API endpoints ↔ Data events remain consistent.

---

## Run the steps
- Run the step files in numeric order in this folder. After each step, summarize decisions, unresolved questions, and proposed defaults for the next step.
- If later steps uncover changes, propose upstream edits and, upon approval, apply them immediately to keep everything consistent.
