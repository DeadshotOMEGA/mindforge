# Feature Documentation Guidelines

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for Claude Code features, agents, and capabilities.

## File Conventions

- **Naming**: Use `.doc.md` suffix for feature documentation (e.g., `activity-tracker.doc.md`)
- **Purpose**: Each file documents a specific feature, agent, or capability in detail
- **Scope**: Internal documentation for understanding system capabilities and implementations

## Documentation Structure

Each feature document should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of what the feature does
2. **Purpose/Use Cases**: Why this feature exists and when to use it
3. **Implementation Details**: How the feature works technically
4. **Usage Examples**: Concrete examples of the feature in action
5. **Integration Points**: How it connects with other system components
6. **Configuration**: Any relevant settings or parameters
7. **Limitations/Constraints**: Known boundaries or restrictions

## Writing Style

- **Technical precision**: Accurate implementation details
- **Concise**: Focus on essential information
- **Actionable**: Include practical examples and usage patterns
- **Current**: Keep synchronized with actual implementations

## Document Types

- **Agent Documentation**: Specialized agents and their capabilities
- **Hook Documentation**: Event handlers and integrations
- **Feature Documentation**: Core system features and behaviors
- **Workflow Documentation**: Process patterns and best practices

## Maintenance

- Update when feature behavior changes
- Add examples when new use cases emerge
- Cross-reference related features
- Remove outdated information promptly

## Target Audience

These docs are for:
- Understanding system capabilities
- Troubleshooting feature behavior
- Extending or modifying features
- Onboarding to advanced functionality
