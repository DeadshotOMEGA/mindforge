title: Technical Specification - Progression Balance & Endgame Content

feature_id: F-13

summary: "Long-term progression mechanics, endgame goals, and balance systems to prevent power creep and economy inflation. Includes soft level caps with diminishing returns, prestige/rebirth system for seasonal resets, additional gold sinks (cosmetics, convenience features), endgame content for max-level players, and economy balance mechanisms."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Progressive XP scaling with soft cap at level 50, exponential growth beyond level 50. Optional prestige system allows level reset while keeping items/materials in exchange for permanent gold bonus. Additional gold sinks prevent economy inflation. Endgame achievement system provides long-term goals for max-level players. Seasonal content and leaderboards drive competitive engagement."

  balance_tuning:
    philosophy: "Early levels (1-20) provide fast progression to encourage engagement. Mid levels (20-50) establish core gameplay loop with moderate pacing. Late levels (50+) create slow grind that incentivizes prestige. Gold sinks prevent inflation while providing meaningful choices."

    progression_pacing:
      - "Levels 1-20: ~30 minutes per level (fast early game)"
      - "Levels 20-50: ~2 hours per level (core gameplay)"
      - "Levels 50-60: ~8 hours per level (prestige incentive)"
      - "Levels 60+: ~20+ hours per level (theoretical maximum)"

    gold_economy_targets:
      - "Average combat reward: 50 gold"
      - "Daily quest reward: 200 gold"
      - "Achievement rewards: 500-5000 gold"
      - "Major sinks: Item upgrades (100-5000), loadout expansion (5000)"
      - "Minor sinks: Cosmetic rerolls (1000), fast travel (100), pet rename (250)"
      - "Goal: Players feel 'wealthy enough' but have meaningful spending choices"

    retention_hooks:
      - "Prestige system for competitive players seeking leaderboard rankings"
      - "Collection completion for completionist players"
      - "Seasonal content for recurring engagement and FOMO"
      - "Social features (leaderboards, achievements) for comparison and status"

dependencies:
  libraries: "SwiftUI for prestige confirmation dialogs, achievement progress displays"
  services: "Backend progression logic, XP calculation functions, achievement tracking system"
  data_sources: "PlayerProgression table (extended), EconomyTransactions for gold sinks, combat victory events for XP awards"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "MVP: None (focus on core gameplay loop first)"
    - "Post-MVP Phase 1: XP soft cap implementation, basic endgame achievements, gold sink features (cosmetic rerolls, loadout expansion)"
    - "Post-MVP Phase 2: Prestige system with permanent gold bonuses, seasonal leaderboards"
    - "Future: Full seasonal content with unique rewards, advanced cosmetic systems, social features"
    - "Critical: XP formula must feel rewarding early but create clear prestige incentive at level 50+. Gold sinks must be desirable but not mandatory."
