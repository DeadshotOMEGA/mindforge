title: Technical Specification - Material Drop System
template: ~/.claude/file-templates/init-project/feature-spec/feature-title.yaml
feature_id: F-05
status: planned
last_updated: 2025-10-20

summary: "Enemies drop gold (100% chance) and materials (60% chance). Material drops use tier-based rarity system with derived strength classification. Drop weights calculated as base_drop_weight × tier_multiplier from LootPoolTierWeights. Enemy level equals player's average equipped item level."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "On combat victory, roll for material drop (60% chance). If success, select weighted random material from location-specific LootPool using tier-based system. Materials auto-classified into tiers (common/uncommon/rare/epic) based on stat modifier magnitude. Drop weights = base_drop_weight × tier_multiplier. Always award gold (random amount in enemy's level-scaled range)."

    Tier-Based Drop Calculation Flow (Server-Side):
    1. Validate combat victory (enemy HP = 0)
    2. Get enemy level from combat session
    3. Roll for material drop: random(0, 1) < 0.6 ?
    4. If material drop success:
       a. Query v_loot_pool_material_weights for location's LootPool
       b. Use weighted random selection based on final_weight values
       c. Selected material inherits style from enemy: material.style_id = enemy.style_id
       d. Create material reward: {material_id, style_id}
    5. Calculate gold drop: random(enemy.gold_min, enemy.gold_max)
    6. Update player inventory:
       - player.gold += gold_drop
       - MaterialStacks: increment quantity (or create new row if not owned)
    7. Return rewards to client

    Material Tier Classification (Runtime Computation):
    1. Compute material strength score: ABS(atkPower) + ABS(atkAccuracy) + ABS(defPower) + ABS(defAccuracy)
    2. Query MaterialStrengthTiers to find matching tier:
       - Common: [0.00, 0.12) → Hello Kitty (abs_sum = 0.10)
       - Uncommon: [0.12, 0.20) → Coffee (abs_sum = 0.15)
       - Rare: [0.20, 0.28) → Cocaine (abs_sum = 0.25)
       - Epic: [0.28, 1.00) → Diamond (abs_sum = 0.30)
    3. Material tier determines drop frequency via LootPoolTierWeights

    Drop Weight Calculation (Per Pool Per Material):
    1. Base weight = Materials.base_drop_weight (default 100)
    2. Tier multiplier = LootPoolTierWeights.weight_multiplier for pool + tier
    3. Final weight = base_weight × tier_multiplier
    4. Override: If LootPoolEntries exists for specific material, use drop_weight directly (0 = exclude)

    Level-Gating Example (Hello Kitty Material):
    - Hello Kitty: Uncommon tier (abs_sum = 0.10), inappropriate for early levels
    - Level 1-8 pools: LootPoolEntries override with weight=0 (excluded)
    - Level 9+ pools: Uses default uncommon multiplier 0.7 (reduced but present)
    - Result: Hello Kitty only drops from level 9+ locations

    Example Combat Victory with Tier System:
    Player avg item level: 5
    Enemy level: 5
    Location: "Level 5 Coffee Shop" LootPool
    Tier weights: Common=1.0, Uncommon=0.7, Rare=0.35, Epic=0.15

    Available materials with final weights:
    - Coffee (Uncommon): 100 × 0.7 = 70
    - Gum (Common): 100 × 1.0 = 100
    - Diamond (Epic): 100 × 0.15 = 15
    Total weight pool: 185

    Roll material drop: 0.57 < 0.6 → SUCCESS
    Weighted selection: random(0, 185) = 120 → Gum selected (common tier)
    Inherit style: enemy.style_id = 'caffeinated' → material.style_id = 'caffeinated'
    Gold amount: random(500, 1000) → 743

    Rewards: {gold: 743, material: {material_id: 'gum', style_id: 'caffeinated'}}

  notes:
    - "Light MVP: Hardcoded enemy level = 3, fixed gold = 200, material drop = 100% for testing"
    - "Full MVP: Tier-based drop system with MaterialStrengthTiers and LootPoolTierWeights, 60% material drop rate, level-scaled gold"
    - "Material Tier System: Common [0.00,0.12), Uncommon [0.12,0.20), Rare [0.20,0.28), Epic [0.28,1.00) thresholds"
    - "Drop Weight Examples: Level 1-8 pools exclude uncommon+ materials (weight=0), Level 9+ pools use default tier multipliers (common=1.0, uncommon=0.7, rare=0.35, epic=0.15)"
    - "Auto-Integration: New materials instantly classified into tiers, appear in all pools with default multipliers, can be level-gated via LootPoolEntries overrides"
    - "Finished: Location-specific drop pools, rare material drops, daily bonus drops, streak bonuses"

balancing_parameters:
  material_drop_rate: "60% (ensures steady material income without flooding inventory)"
  style_inheritance: "Materials inherit enemy style_id (styled enemies drop styled materials, normal enemies drop normal materials)"
  gold_scaling: "100-200 × enemy_level (allows ~5 upgrades per combat at same level)"
  enemy_level_formula: "floor(avg_player_item_level) (enemies scale to player, always fair challenge)"
