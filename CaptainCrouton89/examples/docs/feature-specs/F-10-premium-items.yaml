template: ~/.claude/file-templates/init-project/feature-spec/feature-title.yaml
feature_id: F-10
status: incomplete

summary: "Premium currency (Gems) and special single-location items available through premium purchases. Gems currency exists alongside Gold. Premium items flagged as premium_only require Gems to purchase/obtain. Users acquire Gems through real-money purchases (future). Premium items may be exclusive to specific locations or purchasable from premium store. STATUS: PLACEHOLDER SPEC - IAP implementation not yet designed."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Gems currency exists alongside Gold. Premium items flagged as premium_only require Gems to purchase/obtain. Users acquire Gems through real-money purchases (future). Premium items may be exclusive to specific locations or purchasable from premium store. Currencies table (GOLD, GEMS), UserCurrencyBalances replaces Users.gold_balance, ItemTypes.premium_only boolean field."
  data_schema: "Currencies table (GOLD, GEMS), UserCurrencyBalances replaces Users.gold_balance, ItemTypes.premium_only boolean field. Future: IAPProducts, IAPPurchases, StoreItems, Entitlements tables for full monetization system."
  api_endpoints:
    - "GET /currencies (list available currency types)"
    - "GET /users/me/balances (get user's currency balances)"
    - "POST /iap/purchase (future - initiate gem purchase)"
    - "GET /store/premium-items (future - browse premium catalog)"
  integration_points:
    - "Base items (F-03) extended with premium_only flag"
    - "Combat system (F-02) respects premium item spawn rules"
    - "Economy system tracks both GOLD and GEMS via EconomyTransactions"

  diagrams: "Future Implementation Checklist: 1. Define monetization strategy (pricing, bundles, premium vs cosmetic) 2. Choose IAP platform (Apple/Google/web payments) 3. Design store UI/UX 4. Implement IAPProducts, IAPPurchases tables 5. Integrate payment SDK 6. Add server-side receipt validation 7. Create premium item catalog (StoreItems) 8. Design entitlements system (premium features beyond items) 9. Add gem spending flows 10. Implement refund handling. Complexity Estimate: 4-6 weeks for full monetization system."

dependencies:
  libraries: "Apple StoreKit, Google Play Billing SDK, payment processing SDK"
  services: "Apple Developer account ($99/year), Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time), Server-side receipt validation service"
  data_sources: "IAP platform APIs, payment processor APIs, fraud detection services"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "Current State: Currencies table exists with GOLD (active) and GEMS (reserved), UserCurrencyBalances tracks both but GEMS always 0, No way to acquire GEMS yet, No premium items in seed data yet"
    - "Open Questions: What gem bundle tiers should we offer? Should premium items be exclusive single-location spawns or purchasable anywhere? What IAP platform integration? Should gems be earnable through gameplay or purchase-only? Premium items: cosmetic only or stat advantages allowed?"
    - "Technical Debt: Users.gold_balance field deprecated but not removed (migration needed), No actual IAP implementation (placeholder spec only), No premium item seed data (ItemTypes.premium_only field needed), No store UI/UX (placeholder endpoints only)"
