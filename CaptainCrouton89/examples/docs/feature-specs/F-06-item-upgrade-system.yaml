title: Technical Specification - Item Upgrade System

feature_id: F-06
status: planned

summary: "Spend gold to increase item level. Each level increases all item stats proportionally while maintaining normalized ratios. Gold cost increases exponentially with level and scales by item rarity. Upgrading contributes to vanity level progression."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Player selects item and spends gold to level it up. Item level increments by 1. All stats scale by new level and rarity (base_stats × rarity_multiplier × level). Gold cost formula: base_cost × level_multiplier^(level-1) × rarity_multiplier. Vanity level increases based on total item levels across all items."
  data_schema: "player_items.level incremented, player.gold decremented, player.vanity_level recalculated"
  api_endpoints:
    - "POST /items/:item_id/upgrade"
    - "GET /items/:item_id/upgrade-cost"
  integration_points:
    - "Base items (F-03) receive level multiplier"
    - "Styled materials (F-04) are visual variants with normal stat effectiveness"
    - "Combat drops (F-05) provide gold for upgrades"

    Upgrade Flow:
    1. Player views item detail screen
    2. Client requests GET /items/:id/upgrade-cost
    3. Server calculates cost: base_cost × level_multiplier^(level-1) × rarity_multiplier
    4. Server checks player.gold >= cost
    5. Client displays "Upgrade to Level X" button with cost
    6. Player taps upgrade button
    7. Client sends POST /items/:id/upgrade
    8. Server validates gold, decrements gold, increments item.level
    9. Server recalculates item stats: base_stats × rarity_multiplier × new_level × base_value + material_mods
    10. Server recalculates vanity_level: sum(all_item_levels) / 6 (or custom formula)
    11. Server returns updated item, gold, vanity_level
    12. Client displays success animation and updated stats

    Gold Cost Formula (Updated with Rarity Scaling):
    Formula: cost = base_cost × level_multiplier^(target_level - 1) × rarity_cost_multiplier

    Constants:
    - base_cost = 100 gold (cost to upgrade from level 1 → 2)
    - level_multiplier = 1.5 (exponential scaling factor)
    - rarity_cost_multiplier:
      * common: 1.0
      * uncommon: 1.3
      * rare: 1.6
      * epic: 2.0
      * legendary: 2.5

    Examples (Common Items):
    Level 1 → 2: 100 × 1.5^0 × 1.0 = 100 gold
    Level 2 → 3: 100 × 1.5^1 × 1.0 = 150 gold
    Level 3 → 4: 100 × 1.5^2 × 1.0 = 225 gold
    Level 5 → 6: 100 × 1.5^4 × 1.0 = 506 gold
    Level 10 → 11: 100 × 1.5^9 × 1.0 = 3,834 gold

    Examples (Rarity Scaling):
    Rare level 1 → 2: 100 × 1.5^0 × 1.6 = 160 gold
    Epic level 3 → 4: 100 × 1.5^2 × 2.0 = 450 gold
    Legendary level 5 → 6: 100 × 1.5^4 × 2.5 = 1,266 gold

    Vanity Level Calculation:
    Simple formula (MVP1):
    vanity_level = floor(sum_of_all_item_levels / 6)

    Example:
    6 items at level 5 each → sum = 30 → vanity = 5
    6 items at levels [10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4] → sum = 40 → vanity = 6

    Alternative (post-MVP):
    vanity_level = floor(sqrt(sum_of_all_item_levels))
    Grows slower, more meaningful progression

    Stat Scaling Formula (Updated with Rarity):
    final_stats = base_stats_normalized × rarity_multiplier × level × base_stat_value + material_modifiers

    Constants:
    - base_stat_value = 10 (baseline stat point at level 1)
    - rarity_multiplier:
      * common: 1.00
      * uncommon: 1.25
      * rare: 1.50
      * epic: 1.75
      * legendary: 2.00

    Example: Common Sword (base_stats_normalized = {atkPower: 0.5, atkAccuracy: 0.2, defPower: 0.2, defAccuracy: 0.1})

    Level 1 (common): atkPower = 0.5 × 1.00 × 1 × 10 = 5, total = 10 stat points
    Level 5 (common): atkPower = 0.5 × 1.00 × 5 × 10 = 25, total = 50 stat points
    Level 5 (legendary): atkPower = 0.5 × 2.00 × 5 × 10 = 50, total = 100 stat points

    Material Modifiers (Applied Additively):
    - Normal materials: base effectiveness
    - Styled materials: visual variants with normal stat effectiveness
    - Materials provide zero-sum stat shifts: {atkPower: +0.1, defPower: -0.1}
    - Applied as percentage: final_stat = base_stat × (1 + material_modifier_sum)

    Example with styled iron (+0.1 defPower, -0.1 atkPower at normal effectiveness):
    Styled iron modifier: +0.12 defPower, -0.12 atkPower
    Level 5 common sword: atkPower = 25 × (1 - 0.12) = 22, defPower = 10 × (1 + 0.12) = 11.2
