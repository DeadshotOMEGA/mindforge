summary: "Integrate Google Maps to display player location and nearby enemy spawn points. Enable location-based discovery by tracking GPS position and calculating proximity to spawn locations."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Track player GPS coordinates continuously. Query backend for spawn locations within radius. Display markers on map. Activate locations when player within 50m threshold. GPS permission required to proceed - show permission request popup on app launch and block progression until granted."
  data_schema: "Locations table: id, lat, lng, city_id, enemy_type, item_type, spawn_radius. Player location tracked client-side."
  api_endpoints:
    - "GET /locations/nearby?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={meters}"
    - "GET /locations/:id"
  integration_points:
    - "Google Maps SDK for iOS"
    - "CoreLocation framework for GPS"
    - "Backend location service"

detailed_design:
  data_structures:
    - name: "locations"
      columns:
        - "id: UUID (PK)"
        - "lat: DECIMAL(10,8)"
        - "lng: DECIMAL(11,8)"
        - "location_type: VARCHAR (library, gym, park, coffee_shop, etc.)"
        - "state_code: VARCHAR (US state code: CA, NY, TX, etc.)"
        - "country_code: VARCHAR (ISO country code: USA, CAN, etc.)"
        # enemy_type and item_type deprecated - now handled by EnemyPools and LootPools
        - "spawn_radius: INT (default 50m)"
        - "is_premium: BOOLEAN (default false)"
        - "created_at: TIMESTAMP"

  apis:
    - method: "GET"
      endpoint: "/locations/nearby"
      request: "Query params: lat (float), lng (float), radius (int, meters)"
      response: "{locations: [{id, lat, lng, enemy_type, item_type, distance_meters}]}"
      errors:
        - "400: Invalid coordinates"
        - "500: Database error"

    - method: "GET"
      endpoint: "/locations/:id"
      request: "Path param: id (UUID)"
      response: "{id, lat, lng, city_id, enemy_type, item_type, spawn_radius, is_premium}"
      errors:
        - "404: Location not found"

    Map View Flow:
    1. App launches → Request location permissions via popup
    2. If permission denied → Show blocking alert explaining GPS is required, re-request permission (loop until granted)
    3. Once permission granted → CLLocationManager starts tracking
    4. On location update → Center map, query /locations/nearby
    5. Render markers on map
    6. Monitor distance to each location
    7. When distance < spawn_radius → Activate marker (change color/icon)
    8. Player taps active marker → Launch encounter (trigger F-02)

    Permission Handling:
    - On first launch: Request "When In Use" location permission
    - On denial: Block app with modal explaining GPS is required for gameplay
    - Provide "Open Settings" button to guide user to enable location services
    - Re-check permission status when app returns from background
    - No fallback mode - GPS is mandatory for core gameplay

dependencies:
  libraries: "Google Maps SDK for iOS (pod 'GoogleMaps'), CoreLocation"
  services: "Google Maps API with API key, backend location service"
  data_sources: "PostgreSQL locations table, real-time GPS from device"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "Light MVP: Use static hardcoded locations (no backend), simple map with pins"
    - "Full MVP: Integrate Google Maps API, real GPS tracking, backend location queries"
    - "Finished: Optimize marker rendering for 100+ locations, add location clustering, offline caching"
