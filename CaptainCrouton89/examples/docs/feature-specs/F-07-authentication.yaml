summary: "Secure user registration, login, and session management via Supabase Auth. Supports email/password authentication with email verification, password reset, and persistent sessions."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Supabase Auth handles user accounts, password hashing, email verification, and JWT token generation. Client stores session token securely. On app launch, check for valid session and auto-login. All API requests include Authorization header with JWT token."
  data_schema: "Supabase auth.users table (managed by Supabase), custom users table for game profile"
  api_endpoints:
    - "Supabase: supabase.auth.signUp()"
    - "Supabase: supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()"
    - "Supabase: supabase.auth.signOut()"
    - "Custom: GET /profile"
  integration_points:
    - "Supabase Auth service"
    - "All backend APIs require auth"

detailed_design:
  data_structures:
    - name: "users (custom game profile)"
      columns:
        - "id: UUID (PK, matches Supabase auth.users.id)"
        - "email: VARCHAR (from Supabase)"
        - "username: VARCHAR (optional, unique)"
        - "level: INT (default 1)"
        - "total_atk: INT (from equipped items)"
        - "total_def: INT"
        - "total_hp: INT"
        - "created_at: TIMESTAMP"
        - "last_login: TIMESTAMP"

  apis:
    - method: "POST"
      endpoint: "Supabase Auth: signUp"
      request: "{email, password}"
      response: "{user: {id, email}, session: {access_token, refresh_token}}"
      errors:
        - "400: Invalid email or weak password"
        - "422: Email already registered"

    - method: "POST"
      endpoint: "Supabase Auth: signInWithPassword"
      request: "{email, password}"
      response: "{user: {id, email}, session: {access_token, refresh_token}}"
      errors:
        - "400: Invalid credentials"

    - method: "GET"
      endpoint: "/profile"
      request: "Header: Authorization Bearer {access_token}"
      response: "{id, email, username, level, total_atk, total_def, total_hp, created_at}"
      errors:
        - "401: Unauthorized (invalid or expired token)"

    - method: "POST"
      endpoint: "Supabase Auth: signOut"
      request: "Header: Authorization Bearer {access_token}"
      response: "{success: true}"

    Registration Flow:
    1. Player enters email/password → Client validates format
    2. Client: supabase.auth.signUp({email, password})
    3. Supabase: Create user in auth.users, send verification email
    4. Supabase: Return session tokens (access_token, refresh_token)
    5. Client: Store tokens in Keychain (secure)
    6. Client: Create game profile via POST /profile/init
    7. Backend: Create user record in users table
    8. Client: Redirect to onboarding/map

    Login Flow:
    1. Player enters email/password
    2. Client: supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({email, password})
    3. Supabase: Validate credentials, return session tokens
    4. Client: Store tokens in Keychain
    5. Client: GET /profile to load player data
    6. Client: Redirect to map

    Session Management:
    - Access token expires after 1 hour
    - Refresh token used to get new access token
    - On app launch: Check for valid session → Auto-login
    - On API 401 error: Refresh token → Retry request
    - On refresh failure: Redirect to login

dependencies:
  libraries: "Supabase Swift SDK (pod 'Supabase'), Keychain for token storage"
  services: "Supabase Auth service, backend profile API"
  data_sources: "Supabase auth.users (managed), custom users table"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "Light MVP: Skip auth (local-only, hardcoded user)"
    - "Full MVP: Supabase Auth integration, registration, login, session management"
    - "Finished: Email verification enforcement, password reset, OAuth providers (Google/Apple), account deletion"
