summary: "8 equipment slots (weapon, offhand, head, armor, feet, accessory_1, accessory_2, pet) with normalized stat blocks. Base items have stats that sum to 1.0, modified by materials and scaled by level. Equipment state tracked in normalized UserEquipment table. Players start with 8 level-1 base items (one per slot)."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Each player has 8 equipment slots. Base items have normalized stats {atkPower, atkAccuracy, defPower, defAccuracy} summing to 1.0. Materials modify these stats (±0.05-0.30). Item rarity provides stat multipliers (1.00-2.00). Item level multiplies base stats. Total player stats = sum of all 8 equipped items."
  data_schema: "Items table with item_type_id, level. Equipment state in UserEquipment table, materials in ItemMaterials table"

    Stat Calculation Flow:
    1. Get base item stats (normalized to 1.0)
    2. Apply rarity multiplier (ItemType.rarity: 1.0-2.0)
    3. Apply each material modifier (±0.1-0.3, sum to 0)
       - Materials have style_id (FK to StyleDefinitions) for visual variants only
       - Style does not affect stat effectiveness
    4. Multiply by item level
    5. Result = item's final stats

    Example:
    Base Sword: {atkPower: 0.4, atkAccuracy: 0.2, defPower: 0.3, defAccuracy: 0.1}
    × Rarity Multiplier (rare): 1.5
    = Rare Base: {atkPower: 0.6, atkAccuracy: 0.3, defPower: 0.45, defAccuracy: 0.15}
    + Iron Material: {atkPower: -0.1, atkAccuracy: 0, defPower: +0.1, defAccuracy: 0}
    + Flame Material: {atkPower: +0.2, atkAccuracy: 0, defPower: -0.2, defAccuracy: 0}
    = Modified: {atkPower: 0.7, atkAccuracy: 0.3, defPower: 0.35, defAccuracy: 0.15}
    × Level 5
    = Final: {atkPower: 3.5, atkAccuracy: 1.5, defPower: 1.75, defAccuracy: 0.75}

    Player Total Stats:
    Sum stats from all 8 equipped items (weapon + offhand + head + armor + feet + accessory_1 + accessory_2 + pet)

    Equipment Slot Distribution:
    - Weapon (3 types): Offensive focus (high atkPower, atkAccuracy)
    - Shield (2 types): Defensive focus (high defPower, defAccuracy)
    - Head (2 types): Balanced awareness
    - Armor (2 types): Defensive focus (covers body/chest/legs)
    - Feet (3 types): Mobility/balanced
    - Accessory_1 (3 types): Utility/mixed stats
    - Accessory_2 (3 types): Utility/mixed stats
    - Pet (5 types): Support with personality system (F-11)

dependencies:
  libraries: "None (SwiftUI for UI)"
  services: "Backend inventory and equipment services"
  data_sources: "PostgreSQL items table, item_types seed data, materials table (F-04), StyleDefinitions table"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "Light MVP: Hardcode 8 base items (one per slot), local stat calculation, simple equip/unequip"
    - "Full MVP: Backend API with 26 base items, database persistence, material integration, stat formulas"
    - "Finished: Multiple base types per slot, visual customization, item tooltips, compare items UI"
    - "Seed data includes: 3 weapons, 2 offhands, 2 head items, 2 armor pieces, 3 footwear, 3 accessories (split across 2 slots), 5 pets = 20 total items"
