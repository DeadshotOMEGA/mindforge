summary: "Turn-based combat with weapon-specific timing dial mechanics. Different weapons have different dial patterns (single_arc, dual_arcs, pulsing_arc, roulette, sawtooth). Player taps moving dial with zone-based outcomes (miss/graze/normal/crit). Player accuracy stat scales zone sizes. Stats calculated from equipped items + pet. Enemy counterattacks after player turn. Combat ends when either HP reaches 0."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Initiate combat when player taps active location. Load enemy data and player's equipped weapon. Display weapon-specific dial pattern (single_arc/dual_arcs/pulsing_arc/roulette/sawtooth) with zone-based hit bands. Player accuracy stat adjusts zone sizes via fn_weapon_bands_adjusted(). On tap, determine hit zone (injure/miss/graze/normal/crit). Apply zone multipliers: injure=-50%, miss=0%, graze=60%, normal=100%, crit=160%+RNG. RNG adds 0-100% bonus multiplier on crit hits. Enemy counterattacks after player turn. Victory rewards materials matching enemy's style_id."

    Combat Flow (Weapon-Specific Dial Mechanics):
    1. Player taps active location
    2. Client: POST /combat/start → Get enemy + player stats + weapon dial config
    3. Server: Load player's equipped weapon from Items → Weapons table
    4. Server: Calculate accuracy-adjusted hit bands using fn_weapon_bands_adjusted(weapon_id, player_accuracy)
    5. Server: Return enemy data (with tier-scaled stats), player stats, weapon pattern, adjusted hit bands
    6. Client: Display combat UI with enemy image, stats, HP bars (styled based on enemy style_id)
    7. Player's turn: Render weapon-specific dial pattern (single_arc/dual_arcs/pulsing_arc/roulette/sawtooth)
    8. Client: Animate dial rotation at weapon's spin_deg_per_s speed
    9. Client: Display color-coded zones based on adjusted hit bands:
       - Red zone (injure): deg_injure (self-damage, -50% multiplier)
       - Gray zone (miss): deg_miss (0% multiplier)
       - Yellow zone (graze): deg_graze (60% multiplier)
       - White zone (normal): deg_normal (100% multiplier)
       - Green zone (crit): deg_crit (160% base + 0-100% RNG bonus)
    10. Player taps → Calculate tap_position_degrees (0-360)
    11. Client: POST /combat/attack with tap_position_degrees
    12. Server: Determine hit_zone by checking tap_position against adjusted band ranges
    13. Server: Apply zone multiplier to base damage
    14. Server: If hit_zone = 'crit', roll RNG bonus multiplier (0.0-1.0) and add to base 1.6x
    15. Server: Calculate damage = (player_ATK * total_multiplier) - enemy_DEF (min 1)
    16. Server: If hit_zone = 'injure', apply negative multiplier (player takes damage)
    17. Server: Calculate enemy counterattack = enemy_ATK - player_DEF (min 1)
    18. Server: Update HPs, return {hit_zone, base_multiplier, crit_bonus_multiplier, damage_dealt, enemy_damage, status}
    19. Client: Display hit zone feedback (color flash, haptics, damage numbers)
    20. Client: Update HP bars
    21. If ongoing: Repeat from step 7
    22. If victory/defeat: POST /combat/complete
    23. Server: Generate reward material with enemy's style_id (styled enemies always drop styled materials)
    24. Client: Display result screen with styled reward (if victory)

    Weapon Pattern Types:
    - single_arc: Standard arc with 5 color-coded bands (most common)
    - dual_arcs: Two parallel arcs, player can tap either for same bands
    - pulsing_arc: Arc that dynamically expands/contracts, changing effective zone sizes
    - roulette: Circular wheel divided into wedge-shaped zones
    - sawtooth: Jagged pattern with irregular zone sizes for advanced players

    Zone Outcome Multipliers (from data-plan):
    - injure: -0.5x (self-damage, player loses HP instead of enemy)
    - miss: 0.0x (no damage)
    - graze: 0.6x (partial hit)
    - normal: 1.0x (full hit)
    - crit: 1.6x base + (0.0 to 1.0) RNG bonus = total 1.6x to 2.6x

    Accuracy Scaling (fn_weapon_bands_adjusted):
    - Low accuracy (e.g., 5): Large injure/miss zones, small crit zone
    - Medium accuracy (e.g., 15): Balanced zones
    - High accuracy (e.g., 30+): Small injure/miss zones, large crit zone
    - Formula uses diminishing returns: accuracy scales bands but not linearly

    UI Requirements:
    - Dial color coding: injure=#FF4444 (red), miss=#666666 (gray), graze=#FFAA44 (yellow), normal=#FFFFFF (white), crit=#44FF44 (green)
    - Haptic feedback: Heavy impact on crit, light impact on normal, no haptic on miss
    - Animation: Screen flash on crit hit, damage number glow effect
    - Visual indicator: Moving pointer/needle shows current tap position on dial
    - Zone size visualization: Clearly delineate band boundaries with gradients or lines

dependencies:
  libraries: "SwiftUI for animations, Haptic feedback (UIImpactFeedbackGenerator)"
  services: "Backend combat logic, fn_weapon_bands_adjusted() and fn_expected_mul_quick() PostgreSQL functions, stat calculation via v_player_equipped_stats and v_enemy_realized_stats views"
  data_sources: "Player equipment from F-03 via v_player_equipped_stats, Weapons table for dial patterns, EnemyTypes with tier scaling, Tiers table (1-20+ tiers)"

implementation_status:
  notes:
    - "Light MVP: Single weapon pattern (single_arc only), hardcoded 5 zones (no accuracy scaling), local damage calculation, 3 tiers max"
    - "Full MVP: All 5 weapon patterns implemented, fn_weapon_bands_adjusted() for accuracy scaling, backend combat sessions (in-memory cache), tier-scaled enemies (1-10 tiers), zone-based hit detection, RNG crit bonuses"
    - "Finished: Polished dial animations for all patterns, weapon-specific haptics, balanced zone sizing across accuracy ranges, 20+ enemy tiers, combat analytics, visual effects for each hit zone"
    - "Critical: Weapon patterns must feel distinct (dual_arcs easier, sawtooth harder). Accuracy scaling should be noticeable (5 acc vs 30 acc feels very different)."
