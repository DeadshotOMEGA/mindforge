title: Technical Specification - Inventory Management System
template: ~/.claude/file-templates/init-project/feature-spec/feature-title.yaml
feature_id: F-09
status: planned
last_updated: 2025-01-27

summary: "Comprehensive inventory management system with item viewing, organizing, filtering, equipment management across 8 slots, and saved loadouts. Players can view all owned items, sort/filter by type/rarity/level, equip/unequip items to appropriate slots, and save/load equipment configurations for quick switching."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Players accumulate items through combat rewards and can organize them in a comprehensive inventory system. Items can be filtered by equipment slot (weapon, offhand, head, armor, feet, accessory_1, accessory_2, pet), sorted by level/rarity/acquisition date, and equipped to 8 equipment slots. Post-MVP adds saved loadouts for quick equipment configuration switching. UserEquipment table is single source of truth for equipped state."
  data_schema: "Items table with user ownership, UserEquipment table for current equipment state (8 slots), Loadouts/LoadoutSlots tables for saved configurations, ItemHistory for audit trail"
  api_endpoints:
    - "GET /inventory?filter_slot=weapon&sort_by=level&sort_order=desc"
    - "GET /equipment (returns 8-slot equipment state)"

    - "DELETE /equipment/{slot_name} (unequip slot)"

    Inventory Management Flow:
    1. Player opens inventory → GET /inventory with optional filters
    2. Items displayed with:
       - Icon (from ItemTypes.appearance_data or Items.generated_image_url)
       - Name, level, rarity indicator
       - Equipped status and slot
       - Applied materials (visual indicators)
    3. Player filters by slot type → re-query with slot_type parameter
    4. Player sorts by level/rarity → re-query with sort parameters

    Equipment Management Flow:
    1. Player opens equipment screen → GET /equipment
    2. Display 8 slots with current items (or empty states)
    3. Player equips item:
       a. From inventory: tap item → show "Equip" button → PUT /equipment/{slot}
       b. Drag and drop from inventory to slot → PUT /equipment/{slot}
    4. Equipment API validates item category matches slot type
    5. Database updates UserEquipment table
    6. Triggers recalculate vanity_level and avg_item_level
    7. UI updates with new total stats

    Loadout System Flow (Post-MVP):
    1. Player configures desired equipment setup
    2. Save loadout → POST /loadouts with name
    3. System copies current UserEquipment → LoadoutSlots
    4. Switch loadouts → PUT /loadouts/{id}/activate
    5. System copies LoadoutSlots → UserEquipment for all slots
    6. UI updates with new equipment and stats

    Equipment Slot Validation:
    - weapon category → weapon slot only
    - offhand category → offhand slot only
    - head category → head slot only
    - armor category → armor slot only
    - feet category → feet slot only
    - accessory category → accessory_1 OR accessory_2 slot
    - pet category → pet slot only

    Stat Calculation (real-time):
    Total Player Stats = SUM(all equipped items' current_stats)
    - Each equipped item contributes: base_stats * rarity_multiplier * level + material_modifiers
    - Vanity Level = SUM(all equipped items' levels)
    - Avg Item Level = AVG(all equipped items' levels) - used for enemy scaling

business_rules:
  equipment_constraints:
    - "Each equipment slot can hold 0 or 1 item"
    - "Items can only be equipped to matching category slots (weapon → weapon slot)"
    - "Accessory category items can be equipped to either accessory_1 OR accessory_2 slot"
    - "Pet category items can only be equipped to pet slot"
    - "Players start with empty equipment slots (tutorial provides first items)"
    - "Unequipping item returns it to inventory immediately"

  inventory_limits:
    - "No inventory size limit for MVP (unlimited item storage)"
    - "Future enhancement: soft cap with expansion options"
    - "Items are never auto-deleted (manual deletion only in future)"

  loadout_constraints:
    - "Maximum 5 saved loadouts per user"
    - "Loadout names must be unique per user"
    - "Only one loadout can be active at a time"
    - "Cannot delete currently active loadout (must switch first)"
    - "Loadouts save snapshot of equipment at creation time"
    - "Missing items (deleted since loadout saved) are skipped during activation"

  stat_calculation:
    - "Total player stats = sum of all 8 equipped items' current_stats"
    - "Vanity level = sum of all equipped items' levels"
    - "Avg item level = average of equipped items' levels (used for enemy scaling)"
    - "Stat changes are immediate on equip/unequip (no confirmation step)"
    - "Empty slots contribute 0 to all calculations"

edge_cases:
  equipment_management:
    - "What if user tries to equip item already equipped elsewhere? → Auto-unequip from current slot, equip to new slot"
    - "What if user deletes item that's currently equipped? → Item removed from equipment slot via CASCADE trigger"
    - "What if user tries to equip item they don't own? → 404 error, no state change"
    - "What if user has no items to equip? → Empty equipment slots shown, total stats are base player stats only"

  loadout_system:
    - "What if loadout contains items user no longer owns? → Skip those slots during activation, warn user"
    - "What if user tries to delete active loadout? → Error message, require switching to different loadout first"
    - "What if user reaches 5 loadout limit? → Disable 'Save New' button, require deletion before creating new"
    - "What if loadout activation would exceed slot limits? → Should not happen (loadouts save valid 8-slot configuration)"

  inventory_display:
    - "What if user has thousands of items? → Pagination prevents performance issues, 50 items per page"
    - "What if item image generation failed? → Show placeholder icon or default item type icon"
    - "What if user filters for slot type with 0 items? → Show empty state with message 'No weapons found'"

implementation_notes:
  database_design:
    complexity: "Medium - normalized equipment state and audit trail"
    estimated_effort: "2-3 weeks for MVP (inventory + equipment), +1 week for loadouts"
    performance_considerations:
      - "UserEquipment table has 8 rows per user (one per slot) - fast queries"
      - "Items table will be largest (thousands per user) - needs pagination and indexes"
      - "Database triggers maintain vanity_level and avg_item_level automatically"
      - "ItemHistory grows over time - consider partitioning after 1M+ rows"

  api_design:
    authentication: "All endpoints require Bearer token authentication"
    error_handling: "Consistent JSON error responses with error codes and messages"
    validation: "Input validation on all endpoints (item ownership, slot types, etc.)"
    caching: "Equipment state can be cached client-side, invalidated on changes"
