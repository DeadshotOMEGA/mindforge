style_implementation_guidelines:

  animation_performance: "All style animations use Core Animation for 60fps performance. Animations can be disabled in accessibility settings."
  style_distribution: "Normal: 70%, Pixel Art: 10%, Watercolor: 8%, Neon: 7%, Sketch: 5% (configurable in backend)"
  scalability: "Visual system designed to support additional styles in future updates. Each style requires: border treatment, background effect, animation, badge design."
  colorblind_support: "Each style uses distinct patterns and shapes in addition to color. Neon uses cyan (colorblind-safe), Watercolor uses blue tones, Pixel uses brown earth tones."

implementation_notes: |
  - Light MVP: Basic layouts with native iOS components, no custom animations, Normal style only
  - Full MVP: Custom components (attack dial, stat bars), basic animations, implement all 5 visual styles with Core Animation
  - Finished: Polished style animations, haptic feedback, accessibility, dark mode support, style-specific victory animations
  - Multi-Style System: Converted from binary shiny/normal to 5 distinct visual styles (Normal, Pixel Art, Watercolor, Neon, Sketch)
  - Style Implementation: Each style requires unique border treatment, background effect, animation loop, and accessibility considerations
  - Use SwiftUI previews for rapid iteration of style variants
  - Extract reusable style components into design system module
  - Document style system API and usage guidelines in separate file (future)
