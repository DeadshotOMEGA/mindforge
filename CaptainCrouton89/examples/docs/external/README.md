- Up to 1080p resolution (4K planned)
- Maximum 20-second clips per generation
- 2-5 minute generation time

**Best For:** High-quality video recreation when API launches

**Important Notes:**
- US/Canada only at launch
- Manual generation required until API releases
- No batch processing or video-to-video editing
- Physics struggles with complex interactions
- Character consistency issues in multi-character scenes

**For Your Project:** Documentation includes code patterns for future API integration with webhook-based async processing patterns ready for when API launches.

## 💡 Integration Patterns

### For 4-8 Second Clips (Primary Use Case)
```bash
# 1. Analyze video with Gemini
# 2. Extract audio, transcribe with ElevenLabs
# 3. Generate recreation with Replicate Veo 3
# 4. Generate audio with ElevenLabs TTS
# 5. Combine using ffmpeg
```

### For Full-Length Videos (Stitching Workflow)
```bash
# 1. Split video into 8-second segments
# 2. Analyze each segment with Gemini (parallel)
# 3. Generate each segment with Replicate (parallel/sequential)
# 4. Stitch with ffmpeg
```

### For Image-to-Video Recreation
```bash
# 1. Extract key frames from original
# 2. Generate similar images with Gemini/Imagen
# 3. Animate images with Replicate I2V models
# 4. Add audio with ElevenLabs
```
