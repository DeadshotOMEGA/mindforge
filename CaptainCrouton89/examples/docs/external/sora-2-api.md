4. Verify third-party providers before use
5. Monitor official docs for API release updates

## Code Example (Anticipated)

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.videos.create(
    model="sora-2",
    prompt="A cinematic shot of a robot walking through a futuristic city",
    size="1280x720",
    seconds="8"
)

video_id = response.id
video_url = response.url
```
