  as_a: "Mobile RPG Player"

  so_that: "I can use skill to maximize damage output in combat"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given player's turn, when attack dial appears, then show moving indicator sweeping across dial"
  - "[ ] Given moving dial, when player taps screen, then stop indicator and calculate multiplier"
  - "[ ] Given tap near center, when indicator stops, then apply high multiplier (1.5x - 2.0x)"
  - "[ ] Given tap far from center, when indicator stops, then apply low multiplier (0.5x - 1.0x)"
  - "[ ] Given multiplier calculated, when applied, then compute damage: base_ATK * multiplier - enemy_DEF"
  - "[ ] Given damage calculated, when applied, then reduce enemy HP and display damage number"
  - "[ ] Given attack complete, when damage applied, then enemy counter-attacks"

context:
  why: "Timing mechanic adds skill-based gameplay beyond just stats, rewarding player engagement during combat"
