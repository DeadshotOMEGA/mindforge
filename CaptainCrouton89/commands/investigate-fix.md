Please investigate and fix this bug. Do not suggest a fix until you have actually identified the issue—doing so is counterproductive and creates more issues. Instead, investigate the relevant code and, once you are completely confident of an issue, implement a fix.

In order to be completely confident, you must have identified a clear root cause of the bug. Making assumptions will just lead to more pain, so make sure you question your assumptions and read files completely rather than assuming functionality or logic.
