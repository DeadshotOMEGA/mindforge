# Validate Feature Implementation

**Feature:** $ARGUMENTS

## Note

This is a stub command for future development.

## Planned Validation Steps

1. Run build and verify no errors
2. Check feature spec acceptance criteria
3. Verify integration points work correctly
4. Run relevant tests (if they exist)
5. Generate validation report

## Current Action

For now, this command will:
- Run the build command
- Report success/failure
- Suggest manual validation steps

**To be designed**: Comprehensive validation workflow
