# Phase 7: Design Specification

**Source:** Feature specs and flows

## Deliverable

`docs/design-spec.yaml` with:
- Design goals and brand guidelines
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Component patterns and interactions
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile-first approach

## Steps

1. **Read template first**: `pdocs template design-spec`

2. **Load feature specs and flows** for UI context

3. **Gather design details** via AskUserQuestion:
   - Design goals and brand approach
   - Color palette and typography scale
   - Spacing and layout system
   - Component patterns
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
   - Responsive breakpoints

4. **Draft spec** using template
   - Keep concise, omit obvious details

5. **Write file** to `docs/design-spec.yaml`

6. **Validate** with `pdocs check`

7. **Exit** with `klaude checkout`
