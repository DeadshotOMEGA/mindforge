# Phase 4: Feature Specifications

**Source:** Existing PRD, stories, and flows

## Deliverable

`docs/feature-specs/*.yaml` (one per PRD feature) with:
- Feature ID and title
- Functional overview
- API endpoints (high-level)
- Data models and relationships
- UI states and interactions
- Edge cases

## Steps

1. **Read template first**: `pdocs template feature-spec`

2. **Load PRD, stories, flows** for context

3. **Get high-level understanding** of implementation approach for each feature

4. **List all feature specs** as bullet points (one per PRD feature):
   - F-01: [Feature Name] - [brief approach]
   - Include high-level technical decisions

5. **Get user approval** on feature list and approaches

6. **Update TodoWrite** with each feature spec

7. **Iterate through each feature spec**:
   - Ask clarifying questions about:
     - API endpoints and methods
     - Data models and relationships
     - UI states and interactions
     - Edge cases and error handling
   - Draft spec using template
   - Write to `docs/feature-specs/{feature-name}.yaml`
   - Mark todo complete

8. **Validate** with `pdocs check` (all PRD features covered)

9. **Exit** with `klaude checkout`
