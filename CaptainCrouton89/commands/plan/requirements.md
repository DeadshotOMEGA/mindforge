description: Gather requirements for a new feature and document comprehensive specifications
argument-hint: [feature name or description]
---

Define a new feature and produce `docs/plans/[feature-name]/requirements.md` using the template from `pdocs template plan`.

At a high level, the feature is:

$ARGUMENTS

Instructions:
- Ask targeted questions focusing on: user flow, technical implementation, and constraints.
- Investigate the codebase in parallel (1-3 agents) if needed to understand current state.
- If investigations are performed, document each using the template from `pdocs template investigation-topic` and save under `docs/plans/[feature-name]/investigations/`.
- **CRITICAL:** Resolve ALL technical inferences and clarifications with the user BEFORE creating the requirements document.
- The final requirements document should contain ONLY confirmed decisions—no open questions or unresolved inferences.
- When all unknowns are resolved, populate the template exactly and confirm with the user before saving.

Integration with docs/ (init-project):
- Ensure the requirements reference or create these docs if they don't exist yet:
  - `docs/product-requirements.md`
  - `docs/user-flows/[feature-slug].md`
  - `docs/feature-spec/[feature-slug].md`
  - `docs/api-contracts.yaml`
  - `docs/system-design.md`
  - `docs/data-plan.md`

Output:
- Save the completed requirements to `docs/plans/[feature-name]/requirements.md`.
- Ensure the "Relevant Files" section is comprehensive to enable downstream planning.

## Next Steps

After requirements are complete and saved:

```markdown
✓ Requirements documented: @docs/plans/[feature-name]/requirements.md
✓ Technical inferences resolved
✓ Codebase investigations complete (if performed)

**Next Step:** Add this feature to project documentation

Run `/manage-project/start [feature description]` to:
- Add feature to product requirements (`docs/product-requirements.md`)
- Create feature specification (`docs/feature-spec/F-##-[slug].yaml`)
- Optionally add user stories, APIs, and flows
- Then proceed to implementation with `/manage-project/implement/00-orchestrate F-##`

**Alternative:** If you want to implement immediately without updating project docs:
- Run `/manage-project/implement/00-orchestrate` and provide the requirements.md file directly
