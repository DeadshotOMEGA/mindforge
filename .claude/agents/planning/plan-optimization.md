# Plan Optimization

## Purpose

Optimize development plans to ensure:
- Progressive disclosure (reveal information incrementally)
- Context window preservation (avoid context drift)
- TDD-compliant incremental implementation
- Architecture alignment with project constraints
- Proper dependency sequencing
- Early risk identification
- Realistic estimation and scoping
- Code samples externalized to reference files

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- Creating a new feature or implementation plan
- Reviewing an existing plan before starting work
- Breaking down a large feature into smaller tasks
- Estimating complexity or effort
- Identifying dependencies and critical paths
- Planning multi-phase projects
- Preparing PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure & Context Preservation

**Plans MUST use progressive disclosure to preserve context window:**

**Three-Level Structure:**
1. **Level 1 - Overview**: High-level goals, timeline, risks (always visible)
2. **Level 2 - Phase Summary**: Dependencies, estimates, exit criteria (expand when active)
3. **Level 3 - Detailed Steps**: Granular tasks with references (expand when executing)

**Context Window Optimization:**
- Externalize code samples to `PATTERNS.md` reference file
- Use references instead of embedding examples inline
- Keep plans focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Provide quick reference links for implementation details
- Avoid context bloat that causes drift in long sessions

**Code Sample Management:**
```markdown
❌ BAD (context bloat):
Implement DAL like this: [50 lines of code]

✅ GOOD (context efficient):
Implement DAL using ADO.NET pattern
**Reference:** PATTERNS.md#data-access-layer
**Quick Check:** Parameterized queries, tenant context
```

See **[PATTERNS.md](PATTERNS.md)** for all code examples and detailed patterns.

### 2. TDD-First Planning

**Every feature MUST be planned with Red-Green-Refactor in mind.**

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#tdd-planning-patterns](PATTERNS.md#tdd-planning-patterns)

**Plan Optimization Checklist:**
- [ ] Each implementation step has corresponding test step BEFORE it
- [ ] RED phase explicitly defined (verify failure)
- [ ] GREEN phase explicitly defined (make it pass)
- [ ] Refactor phase explicitly defined (improve quality)
- [ ] Final verification step included
- [ ] Test coverage target defined (minimum 70%)

### 3. Architecture Constraint Compliance

**ALL plans MUST respect project architectural principles:**

- **No ORM**: Use ADO.NET with stored procedures only
- **Multitenancy**: URL-based tenant detection from request start
- **TDD Methodology**: Test-first, Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Security**: Parameterized queries, no SQL injection, XSS prevention

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#architecture-constraint-examples](PATTERNS.md#architecture-constraint-examples)

### 4. Dependency Sequencing

**Identify and order dependencies properly.**

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#dependency-sequencing-examples](PATTERNS.md#dependency-sequencing-examples)

**Dependency Graph Analysis:**
- Identify all external dependencies (APIs, services, database)
- List all internal dependencies (other modules, shared libraries)
- Define critical path (longest dependency chain)
- Identify parallelizable work
- Flag circular dependencies (architectural smell)

### 5. Risk Assessment Matrix

**Rate risks on Impact (1-5) × Likelihood (1-5) = Risk Score:**

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#risk-assessment-examples](PATTERNS.md#risk-assessment-examples)

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Proof of Concept** - Spike to validate technical approach
2. **Incremental Rollout** - Feature flags, gradual tenant migration
3. **Fallback Plan** - Define rollback strategy before starting
4. **Early Validation** - Clarify requirements before coding
5. **Parallel Development** - Don't block on external dependencies

### 6. Estimation and Scoping

**Use T-Shirt sizing for high-level estimates:**

- **XS (< 2 hours)**: Simple model changes, single method, straightforward test
- **S (2-4 hours)**: Single controller action with tests, simple DAL method
- **M (4-8 hours)**: Complete CRUD for entity, full test coverage, views
- **L (1-2 days)**: Multi-entity feature, integration points, E2E tests
- **XL (2-5 days)**: Complex business logic, multiple integrations, full testing
- **XXL (5+ days)**: Consider breaking down into smaller features

**Estimation Red Flags (break it down further):**
- More than 10 steps in a single phase
- Step estimated > 4 hours
- Unclear success criteria
- "And" appearing multiple times in single step
- No testable outcomes defined

**Blocked**: 0

**Total Estimated Hours**: Xh
**Actual Hours Spent**: Yh
**Remaining Hours**: Zh
**On Track**: Yes/No (X% complete)
```

### File Naming Convention

- Pattern: `[task-name]-[type].md`
- Example: `008-tw-ai-docs-plan.md`, `008-tw-ai-docs-context.md`, `008-tw-ai-docs-tasks.md`
- Task name should match directory name: `dev/active/008-tw-ai-docs/`

### Using `/dev-docs-update`

The `/dev-docs-update` command updates context and tasks files:

**What it updates:**
1. `[task-name]-context.md`:
   - Current implementation state
   - Key decisions made this session
   - Files modified
   - Blockers discovered
   - Next immediate steps
   - Session tracking entry

2. `[task-name]-tasks.md`:
   - Mark completed tasks as ✅
   - Update in-progress tasks with status
   - Add new tasks discovered
   - Update actual hours spent
   - Recalculate progress percentages

**When to run:**
- Before context limits (preserve session work)
- After completing major milestone
- Before switching tasks
- End of work session
- When blockers are discovered

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Update all active tasks
/dev-docs-update

# Update with specific context
/dev-docs-update "Completed Phase 1, discovered issue with DocFX path resolution"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep plan file stable** - Don't edit frequently, it's the source of truth
2. **Update context file regularly** - Capture decisions as they're made
3. **Update tasks file constantly** - Mark ✅ immediately when done
4. **Use PATTERNS.md for code** - Keep samples out of plan/context/tasks
5. **Session tracking** - Document what happened each session in context file
6. **Blockers visibility** - Always update context file when blocked
7. **Metrics accuracy** - Keep hours and percentages current in tasks file

### Integration with Progressive Disclosure

The three-file format works WITH progressive disclosure:
- **Plan file**: Use progressive disclosure (collapsible sections)
- **Context file**: Flat structure (always need quick access)
- **Tasks file**: Grouped by phase (easy scanning)
- **PATTERNS.md**: External reference (preserve context)

**Combined approach:**
```
dev/active/008-tw-ai-docs/
├── 008-tw-ai-docs-plan.md          (26KB - progressive disclosure)
├── 008-tw-ai-docs-context.md       (15KB - flat structure)
├── 008-tw-ai-docs-tasks.md         (18KB - phase-grouped)
├── PATTERNS.md                      (21KB - code samples)
├── README.md                        (overview, links to core files)
└── archive/                         (old detailed docs)
```

**Total active context**: ~80KB (plan + context + tasks + patterns)
**Archive context**: ~280KB (reference only, rarely accessed)
**Context reduction**: 14x improvement over flat structure

## Common Planning Anti-Patterns

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#anti-patterns](PATTERNS.md#anti-patterns)

Key anti-patterns to avoid:
- ❌ Implementation-first planning (not TDD)
- ❌ Big-bang integration (not incremental)
- ❌ Vague success criteria (not measurable)
- ❌ Ignoring architecture constraints (causes rework)
- ❌ Context bloat (embedding code samples inline)
- ❌ Flat plans (no progressive disclosure)

## Optimization Techniques

**Reference:** [PATTERNS.md#optimization-techniques](PATTERNS.md#optimization-techniques)

Key optimization strategies:
1. **Incremental Delivery** - Break into valuable increments
2. **Parallel Development** - Identify independent work streams
3. **De-Risk Early** - Tackle highest-risk items first
4. **Testable Milestones** - Define clear checkpoints
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Use three-level structure
6. **Code Sample Externalization** - Reference, don't embed

## Integration with Project Workflow

### Creating Plans with `/dev-docs`

**Recommended workflow:**
1. **Use `/dev-docs` command** to generate standard three-file structure
2. **Apply plan-optimization skill** to the generated plan:
   - Add progressive disclosure (collapsible sections)
   - Externalize code samples to PATTERNS.md
   - Break into TDD-compliant phases
   - Add risk assessment and mitigation
3. **Result**: Optimized plan in standard format, compatible with `/dev-docs-update`

**Example:**
```bash
# Generate initial plan
/dev-docs "Create comprehensive documentation system for TailorWell.Admin"

# Then optimize the generated plan using this skill
# - Add PATTERNS.md with code samples
# - Apply progressive disclosure to plan file
# - Ensure TDD compliance in all phases
# - Archive detailed docs if context too large
```

### Development Context Updates

Use `/dev-docs-update` command throughout development:
- **Before context limits** - Preserve session work
- **After major milestones** - Capture decisions and progress
- **When blocked** - Document blockers in context file
- **End of session** - Update tasks checklist, session tracking

**What gets updated:**
- `[task-name]-context.md` - Decisions, files modified, blockers, next steps
- `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Mark ✅ completed, update hours, add new tasks

### Feature Implementation

Before starting any feature:
1. **Verify `/dev-docs` format** - All three files exist and are current
2. Review plan against this skill's checklist
3. Verify TDD compliance (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in plan)
4. Confirm architecture alignment (no-ORM, multitenancy)
5. Validate dependency sequencing
6. Ensure PATTERNS.md exists for code samples
7. Get stakeholder approval on estimates

**During implementation:**
1. Update `[task-name]-tasks.md` after each task completion
2. Document decisions in `[task-name]-context.md` as they're made
3. Reference PATTERNS.md instead of copying code inline
4. Run `/dev-docs-update` before context limits

## Quick Reference

**Plan Creation Flow:**
1. Define success criteria (measurable outcomes)
2. List architecture constraints (no-ORM, multitenancy)
3. Identify dependencies (external, internal)
4. Assess risks (impact × likelihood)
5. Break into TDD phases (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
6. Estimate each phase (T-shirt sizing)
7. Define exit criteria per phase
8. Document rollback plan
9. Review against checklist
10. Get approval before starting

**Optimization Questions:**
- Does plan follow `/dev-docs` format? (three files: plan, context, tasks)
- Is plan using progressive disclosure? (three-level structure)
- Are code samples externalized? (reference PATTERNS.md)
- Is context preserved? (plan < 300 lines, focused on WHAT/WHY)
- Can this be smaller? (aim for < 5 day increments)
- Can we deliver value earlier? (incremental delivery)
- What's the highest risk? (de-risk first)
- Are tests written first? (TDD compliance)
- Does it respect architecture? (no-ORM, multitenancy)
- Is it testable? (clear success criteria)
- Can parts run in parallel? (resource optimization)
- Is `/dev-docs-update` ready? (context and tasks files current)
